## OpenAgent Vision

OpenAgent is the AI that actually does things.
It runs on your devices, in your channels, with your rules.

This document explains the current state and direction of the project.
We are still early, so iteration is fast.
Project overview and developer docs: [`README.md`](README.md)
Contribution guide: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)

OpenAgent is a course edition by Celaya Solutions, derived from OpenClaw.
It keeps the Gateway, the CLI, the Control UI, and a small set of plugins so
students can build it from source, read it, and change it.

The goal: a personal assistant that is easy to use, supports a wide range of platforms, and respects privacy and security.

OpenAgent is a great personal assistant and a great team assistant.
A personal install is yours alone; a shared Gateway is a place people work together, so the same session can carry several humans, their credit, and their history.

The current focus is:

Priority:

- Security and safe defaults
- Bug fixes and stability
- Setup reliability and first-run UX

Next priorities:

- Supporting all major model providers
- Improving support for major messaging channels (and adding a few high-demand ones)
- Performance and test infrastructure
- Better computer-use and agent harness capabilities
- Ergonomics across CLI and web frontend

Contribution rules:

- One PR = one issue/topic. Do not bundle multiple unrelated fixes/features.
- PRs over ~5,000 changed lines are reviewed only in exceptional circumstances.
- Do not open large batches of tiny PRs at once; each PR has review cost.
- For very small related fixes, grouping into one focused PR is encouraged.

Configuration compatibility:

OpenAgent runtime code reads the current configuration schema only.
We do not keep long-lived aliases or compatibility branches that silently accept old, renamed, or malformed config keys.

When a config change makes existing user config invalid, the same change needs a doctor migration.
`openclaw doctor --fix` should detect the old shape, explain it, back it up when needed, and rewrite it to the canonical format.
Core-owned config and auth state are repaired in core doctor code; plugin-owned config is repaired by that plugin's doctor contract.

## Security

Security in OpenAgent is a deliberate tradeoff: strong defaults without killing capability.
The goal is to stay powerful for real work while making risky paths explicit and operator-controlled.

Canonical security policy and reporting:

- [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)

We prioritize secure defaults, but also expose clear knobs for trusted high-power workflows.

Privacy follows the same default rule.
OpenAgent sends no usage analytics, tracking identifiers, or telemetry attribution to the project unless the operator turned that on themselves.
This rule governs what leaves your install. It is not a rule about shared Gateways: when you join a team Gateway, the people you share it with see the work you do there, and features like Git co-author credit exist to attribute that work to you.
This build has no default telemetry or update-check endpoint: nothing is sent until the operator sets `OPENCLAW_TELEMETRY_ENDPOINT` to a server they run.
See [`docs/gateway/telemetry.md`](docs/gateway/telemetry.md).

## Plugins & Memory

OpenAgent has an extensive plugin API.
Core stays lean; optional capabilities should usually ship as plugins.
We are generally slimming down core while expanding what plugins can do.
If a useful feature cannot be built as a plugin yet, we welcome PRs and design discussions that extend the plugin API instead of adding one-off core behavior.

Two layers, two bars.
The core carries a per-call tax: each core tool, prompt line, and config key reaches every operator on every model request, so additions there face the strictest scrutiny.
Plugins, skills, channels, and apps carry no such tax, and we want that surface to keep growing.
When our contribution rules read as hostile to a feature, re-check the layer: usually they object to where it plugs in, not to the feature existing.

Recurring demand defines interfaces.
Once several independent PRs or requests wire in the same kind of capability, the right response is a contract, not a queue of merges: land the seam in core or the SDK, port the bundled implementation onto it, and let the remaining candidates ship as plugins against it.

There are two broad plugin styles:

- Code plugins run OpenAgent plugin code and are appropriate for deeper runtime extension.
- Bundle-style plugins package stable external surfaces such as skills, MCP servers, and related configuration.

Prefer bundle-style plugins when they can express the capability.
They have a smaller, more stable interface and better security boundaries.
Use code plugins when the capability needs runtime hooks, providers, channels, tools, or other in-process extension points.

If you build a plugin, host and maintain it in your own repository and load it locally during development.
The bar for adding optional plugins to this repository is intentionally high.
Plugin docs: [`docs/tools/plugin.md`](docs/tools/plugin.md)
OpenAgent docs document core extension points and the bundled plugins; they do not promote third-party plugins.

Memory is a special plugin slot where only one memory plugin can be active at a time.
Today we ship multiple memory options; over time we plan to converge on one recommended default path.

### Skills

We still ship some bundled skills for baseline UX.
New skills should live in your own workspace or plugin first, not be added to core by default.
Official or bundled promotion should require a clear product, security, or maintainer-ownership reason.

### MCP Support

OpenAgent supports MCP as both a server and a runtime integration surface.
MCP details live in [`docs/cli/mcp.md`](docs/cli/mcp.md).

The project goal is pragmatic MCP support without duplicating existing agent,
tool, ACPX, or plugin paths.

### Setup

OpenAgent is currently terminal-first by design.
This keeps setup explicit: users see docs, auth, permissions, and security posture up front.

Long term, we want easier onboarding flows as hardening matures.
We do not want convenience wrappers that hide critical security decisions from users.

### Why TypeScript?

OpenAgent is primarily an orchestration system: prompts, tools, protocols, and integrations.
TypeScript was chosen to keep OpenAgent hackable by default.
It is widely known, fast to iterate in, and easy to read, modify, and extend.

## What We Will Not Merge (For Now)

- New core skills when they can live in a workspace or plugin
- Full-doc translation sets for all docs (deferred; we plan AI-generated translations later)
- Commercial service integrations that do not clearly fit the model-provider category
- Cloud-based sandbox providers as OpenAgent plugins
- Wrapper channels around already supported channels without a clear capability or security gap
- MCP work that duplicates existing MCP, ACPX, or plugin paths without a clear product or security gap
- Heavy orchestration layers that duplicate existing agent and tool infrastructure

This list is a roadmap guardrail, not a law of physics.
Strong user demand and strong technical rationale can change it.
